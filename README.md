# 2952Q_FinalProject

This repository contains the code and resources for the final project of the class [CSCI2952Q: Robust Algorithms in Machine Learning](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ycheng79/csci2952qf24.html). The project focuses on the robust estimation of the edge probability \(p\) in the Erdős-Rényi random graph model under adversarial perturbation of vertices.

## Abstract
We define a new class of adversarial models, the \((q, \epsilon)\)-adversarial model, and we present novel algorithms: mean_adjusted_mean and the variance_method.
